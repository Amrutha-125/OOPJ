* **Loan Application:** Simulates a loan application process with basic eligibility checks and approval based on predefined criteria.

**Project Structure:**

* **src/main/java:** Contains the Java source code for all classes and functionalities.
    * **banking_project:** Package containing your banking application classes.
        * **Account:** Abstract base class for all account types.
            * **SavingsAccount:** Implements savings account functionality.
            * **FixedDeposit:** Implements fixed deposit functionality.
