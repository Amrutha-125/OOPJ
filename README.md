* **Fixed Deposit:** Allows creating fixed deposits with a specified term and interest rate.
* **Deposit with Withdrawal:** Represents an account with flexible deposits and withdrawals, but without interest earning.
* **Loan Application:** Simulates a loan application process with basic eligibility checks and approval based on predefined criteria.

**Project Structure:**

* **src/main/java:** Contains the Java source code for all classes and functionalities.
    * **com.yourcompany.banking:** Package containing your banking application classes.
        * **Account:** Abstract base class for all account types.
            * **SavingsAccount:** Implements savings account functionality.
            * **FixedDeposit:** Implements fixed deposit functionality.
            * **DepositWithWithdrawal:** Implements flexible deposit/withdrawal account functionality.
        * **LoanApplication:** Handles loan application process.
        * **Utilities:** Contains helper classes for common tasks like input validation.
* **src/test/java:** (Optional) Unit tests for your classes.
* **README.md:** This file (you're reading it now!).

**Building and Running:**

1. Ensure you have Java installed and configured.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run `mvn clean compile` to build the project.
4. Run `mvn exec:java` to execute the main class and start the application.

**Usage:**

The application presents a menu-driven interface for users to interact with. Options include:

* Creating new accounts (savings, fixed deposit, or deposit with withdrawal)
* Depositing and withdrawing funds
* Checking account balance
* Applying for a loan
* (Optional) Additional features can be added as needed.

**Dependencies:**

This project requires no external dependencies beyond the standard Java libraries.

**Further Development:**

This is a basic implementation and can be extended in various ways:

* Implement additional account types (checking, loan, etc.)
* Integrate with a database for persistent data storage
* Enhance security features (user authentication, encryption)
* Implement real-time transaction processing
* Develop a graphical user interface (GUI)
* Add error handling and validation checks

Feel free to modify and build upon this project as needed for your learning and development purposes.
